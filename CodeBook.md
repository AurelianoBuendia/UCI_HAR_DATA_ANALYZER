This file contains the name for all the variables in the tidy data set (result_data.txt), and describes the meaning, the origin and the transformations done to them.

"Subject" - Integer values from 1 to 30, representing the individuals that performed the monitored activities in the experiment. 
The correlation between individuals, activities and measures is positional, based on the lines in files subject_train.txt, Y_train.txt, and X_train.txt, respectively, 
and files subject_test.txt, Y_test.txt and X_test.txt, respectively.
"Activity_label" - Integer values from 1 to 6, as defined in the file activity_labels.txt. 
The correlation between Subjects, Activities and measures is explained in the previous variable.

The next variables (not including the last one, "Activity_name") contain numerical (double) data representing the mean values for the mean and std (standard deviation) measures, 
extracted from X_train.txt and Y_train.txt files.
