In order to execute the script "run_analysis.R", you need to set your workin path in the first executable line of the script:
setwd('C:/source/UCI_HAR_Dataset/data')

After this the script is ready to be executed. /test and /train original folders must be under the working directory.
The results for the processing will be stored in the file "result_data.txt", which contains the columns named below.
Data for the "mean" and "std" original columns were grouped by "Sbject" and "Activity_label" and averaged.
Activy names were included in the column "Activity_name"
Thanks!
